## How do I approach designing software?

Approaching software design involves a systematic and iterative process. Initially, to understand the project requirements and objectives I made sure I read through the requirements and identified the problem to be solved, the target audience, and any constraints or limitations. Working on this project has helped me hone several design skills. I have gained a deeper understanding of system architecture, modular design, and component-based development. Additionally, I have learned to analyze and prioritize requirements, effectively communicate design decisions, and create user-friendly interfaces. The project also enhanced my skills in considering scalability, maintainability, and performance optimization during the design phase.

I followed a well-defined design process. It began with a thorough requirement analysis, followed by conceptualizing the overall architecture and designing individual components. I used techniques such as UML diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframes to visualize and communicate the design. I iteratively refined the design based on feedback from the Instructor and incorporated best practices for code organization, documentation, and testing. The tactics from my design approach can be applied in future work by emphasizing the importance of requirements analysis and a systematic design process. Breaking down complex problems into manageable components, prioritizing flexibility and reusability.

## How do I approach developing programs?

Developing this program involved a combination of planning, coding, testing, and iterative refinement. I started by understanding the problem domain and designing a solution. While working on the 3D scene, I employed various development strategies. I utilized object-oriented programming principles to organize code into reusable and maintainable classes. I practiced modular development, encapsulating functionality within individual components. Version control systems allowed for collaboration and tracking changes. Continuous integration and automated testing helped ensure the stability of the project.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

The knowledge I gained from this course can be applied in various professional pathways. In data analysis, visualizations help in conveying insights and patterns effectively. In user interface design, understanding visual perception and interaction principles enables the creation of intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. In fields like architecture and product design, visualizations aid in prototyping and presenting ideas.
